    </div>	<p>There are many different ways to put a website out on the internet, and it has only gotten easier over the years!</p><br>

	<p>This simple website was made for free using github pages. Anyone could make a similar website using a paid service, or a self hosted webserver. The documentation for Github pages is cited below.</p>
