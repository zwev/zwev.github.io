		     <li><span class="hobby">Music</span>: I have been playing music for most of my life, and I have really eclectic tastes.</li><br>
		     <li><span class="hobby">Engineering</span>: I have tinkered with things since I was a kid, which helped foster my love for building things. Weather it's physical or digital, I'm always looking for a new project; sometimes I finish them.</li><br>
		     <li><span class="hobby">Gardening</span>: I am an avid gardener, and I like to grow as much food as I can. Whether it is a tomato or some lettuce, fresh produce is always the best!</li><br>
